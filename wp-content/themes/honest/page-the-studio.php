          <p>There are A LOT of personal trainers, bootcamps, and fitness studio's out there! I want you to know right away why Honest Training is different! Honest Training is about sustainable movement... we want to be 60-70 years old and rock'in it! Not trashing our bodies and preventing injury, not creating it!  We are about NOT DIETING... but creating and practicing healthy meal plans that support a healthy active lifestyle. Which includes a glass of wine every once and a while ;)</p>
          <p>We are about loving our bodies... practicing good body image.  We are about community!  Creating a supportive community of accountability is vital for success... being there for each other. Being real, being honest about the struggles as well as celebrating the victories! At Honest Training we offer semi private personal training. This means that you and 4-5 other people will be working out together. It really feel's like you still have a personal trainer... just add in a few other fun people :) This format allows for LOTS of coaching, modifications and more time/room to make the workout individual. This is key for people who need help with form and posture... which is EVERYONE! The semi private training also allows me to have a personal relationship with each and every one of my clients. I know who you are, I know your goals, and you will not be lost in the crowd of a group fitness class. Lastly, it's WAY FUN. Working out with other people is really motivating and fun!  You will find camaraderie, support, community and friendship.</p>

                  <p>Like most women, I had become an ace at yo-yo dieting.</p>
                  <p>You know the deal... the spare tire tummy gets to be too much and you make the strong (and likely overdue) decision to get back on track with healthy eating and exercising. We all dread it, and yet, we all do it (again and again).</p>
                  <p>I was small to average most of growing up until college when my 5’5” frame seamlessly fluctuated plus/minus 30 or so pounds. At my heaviest I was 165lbs. I know it wouldn’t get me a spot on My 600lb Life, but I hated my nasty gut and was only mildly comforted by a slightly bigger chest. It’s not a ton of weight, but for my frame, it was completely unhealthy.</p>
                  <p>My go-to weight loss means was always Weight Watchers - and it worked (temporary) wonders! Swapping out the drinking and loading up on the fat free salad dressing always managed to shed the pounds and have me feeling a little less chubby. But with so much up and down over the (10+) years, I was sick of my body. I was tired of the pep talk I had to give myself to gear up for another few weeks/months of restrictive eating and counting points. I was pissed that I was too lazy to not earn more activity points (basically food credits) during the week so I could enjoy myself more often and eat shitty fried food.</p>
