          <p class="pad-b">Nothing in life is more precious than your health.  Then why is it that we make other things a priority so easily?  Our health and wellness is the foundation of everything we do and everything we are. My favorite words when starting a nutrition program...</p>

            <li class="first"><strong>Recommitment</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Patience</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Practice</strong></li>
            <li class="last"><strong>Consistency</strong></li>
          </ul>

          <p class="pad-t pad-b--0">Success requires these. Everyone WILL experience being challenged by commitment. Make the life you want a priority. When things don’t go as planned, put one foot in front of the other and recommit, be consistent and be patient. There is NO room here for self criticism.</p>
